EECS 206B. Robotic Manipulation and Interaction
Catalog Description: This course is a sequel to EECS C106A/206A, which covers kinematics, dynamics and control of a single robot. This course will cover dynamics and control of groups of robotic manipulators coordinating with each other and interacting with the environment. Concepts will include an introduction to grasping and the constrained manipulation, contacts and force control for interaction with the environment. We will also cover active perception guided manipulation, as well as the manipulation of non-rigid objects. Throughout, we will emphasize design and human-robot interactions, and applications to applications in manufacturing, service robotics, tele-surgery, and locomotion.

EECS 251A. Introduction to Digital Design and Integrated Circuits
Catalog Description: An introduction to digital circuit and system design. The material provides a top-down view of the principles, components, and methodologies for large scale digital system design. The underlying CMOS devices and manufacturing technologies are introduced, but quickly abstracted to higher levels to focus the class on design of larger digital modules for both FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) and ASICs (application specific integrated circuits). The class includes extensive use of industrial grade design automation and verification tools for assignments, labs, and projects.

EECS 251LA. Introduction to Digital Design and Integrated Circuits Lab
Catalog Description: This lab lays the foundation of modern digital design by first presenting the scripting and hardware description language base for specification of digital systems and interactions with tool flows. The labs are centered on a large design with the focus on rapid design space exploration. The lab exercises culminate with a project design, e.g. implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with a register file and caches. The design is mapped to simulation and layout specification.

EECS 251LB. Introduction to Digital Design and Integrated Circuits Lab
Catalog Description: This lab covers the design of modern digital systems with Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platforms. A series of lab exercises provide the background and practice of digital design using a modern FPGA design tool flow. Digital synthesis, partitioning, placement, routing, and simulation tools for FPGAs are covered in detail. The labs exercises culminate with a large design project, e.g., an implementation of a full 3-stage RISC-V processor system, with caches, graphics acceleration, and external peripheral components. The design is mapped and demonstrated on an FPGA hardware platform.
